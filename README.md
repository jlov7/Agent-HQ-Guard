# Agent HQ Guard

> **Governance for Autonomous AI Development**  
> Stop unauthorized agents. Detect protected-path violations. Enforce provenance. Gate merges with confidence.

## The Problem We're Solving

As we enter 2025, GitHub Agent HQ and similar platforms are enabling **multi-agent autonomous coding** at unprecedented scale. Multiple AI agents can now collaborate on codebases simultaneously, bringing revolutionary speed‚Äîbut also unprecedented risk.

**What happens when:**
- An agent exceeds your token budget by 10x?
- An unauthorized AI provider modifies your production infrastructure?
- Sensitive files get changed without proper approvals?
- You can't prove who (or what) made a critical change?

**Answer:** Without guardrails, you're flying blind. Agent HQ Guard puts you back in control.

## Why This Matters Now

The AI development landscape is accelerating faster than traditional governance can keep up. Organizations adopting autonomous agents face:

- **Financial risk** ‚Äî Uncontrolled token usage can spiral costs
- **Security exposure** ‚Äî Agents touching sensitive infrastructure without oversight
- **Compliance gaps** ‚Äî Lack of audit trails and provenance for AI-generated changes
- **Trust deficits** ‚Äî Teams hesitant to adopt AI without governance

Agent HQ Guard bridges this gap by providing **policy-driven enforcement** that works seamlessly with GitHub's ecosystem while maintaining the speed and flexibility that makes AI agents powerful.

## What Agent HQ Guard Delivers

Agent HQ Guard is a **GitHub App and Action** that enforces policy, provenance, and budget controls across every autonomous agent run. Think of it as CI/CD guards specifically designed for the AI era.

### Core Capabilities

- **üîí Agent Authorization** ‚Äî Whitelist which AI providers can execute in your repositories
- **üí∞ Budget Enforcement** ‚Äî Hard limits on token consumption per run
- **üõ°Ô∏è Protected Path Detection** ‚Äî Block changes to sensitive files without approval
- **‚úçÔ∏è Provenance Verification** ‚Äî Require signed manifests (Sigstore, in-toto, C2PA) for auditability
- **‚úÖ GitHub Checks Integration** ‚Äî Block merges until all policies pass
- **üéõÔ∏è Human Overrides** ‚Äî Slash commands (`/agent-allow`, `/budget`) for maintainer controls

### Architecture Components

| Component | Purpose | Who Uses It |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **GitHub App** (`app/`) | Probot service monitoring PRs, workflows, and checks | DevOps/Platform teams |
| **GitHub Action** (`action/`) | Validates manifests in CI/CD pipelines | Developers |
| **Policy Engine** (`lib/policy/`) | YAML ‚Üí Rego compiler for Sentinel-compatible policies | Security/Policy teams |
| **Provenance Toolkit** (`lib/provenance/`) | Credential validation, signing, and verification | Security/Compliance teams |
| **CLI** (`cli/`) | Local simulation and testing | All developers |
| **Examples** (`examples/`) | Reference implementations | Everyone |

## Two Integration Paths

### 1. Compatibility Mode (Default)
Works with any GitHub Actions workflow. Uses:
- GitHub Checks API for blocking merges
- PR annotations for visibility
- Artifact storage for manifests
- Slash commands for overrides

**Best for:** Teams integrating Guard into existing workflows without Agent HQ access.

### 2. Native Mission Control (Feature-Flagged)
Streams decisions upstream before tools execute. Set `AGENT_HQ_API_URL` to enable:
- Pre-execution allow/deny decisions
- Retry-safe mission control client
- Reduced latency for policy violations

**Best for:** Teams with GitHub Agent HQ access who want proactive enforcement.

## Quick Start

Get Guard running in under 10 minutes:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Create policy file
cp lib/policy/examples/default.yaml .github/agent-hq-guard.yml

# 3. Deploy the app (or run locally)
docker-compose up --build

# 4. Add to your agent workflows
# See examples/parallel-run/ for complete workflow
```

**Full setup:** See [Quick Start Guide](docs/quickstart.md)

## Real-World Use Cases

### Financial Governance
**Problem:** AI agents consuming unbounded tokens, blowing through budgets.  
**Solution:** `max_tokens_per_run: 80000` hard-caps every run. Works with `/budget` overrides for exceptions.

### Security Posture
**Problem:** Agents modifying production infrastructure or secrets without review.  
**Solution:** Protected path patterns (`infra/**`, `.github/**`) require explicit approvals before merge.

### Compliance & Audit
**Problem:** Can't prove what agent made which change, or when.  
**Solution:** Signed provenance manifests (Sigstore + C2PA) provide cryptographic proof of every run.

### Multi-Vendor Control
**Problem:** Need to restrict which AI providers can execute in your org.  
**Solution:** `allow_agents` whitelist ensures only approved providers run.

## Quality & Security

- **Type-safe** ‚Äî Full TypeScript coverage with strict mode
- **Tested** ‚Äî Comprehensive test suite with coverage reporting
- **Deterministic builds** ‚Äî Locked dependencies via `pnpm-workspace`
- **Signed releases** ‚Äî SBOM + cosign signing in CI
- **Security-first** ‚Äî Dependabot auto-updates, strict peer dependencies

Run quality checks:
```bash
pnpm check    # Lint + typecheck + test
pnpm build    # Compile all packages
pnpm coverage # Generate coverage reports
```

## Local Simulation

Test policies before opening PRs:

```bash
pnpm --filter @agent-hq-guard/cli exec hqguard simulate \
  --policy .github/agent-hq-guard.yml \
  --manifests out/*.json
```

See [examples/](examples/) for reference scenarios.

## The Vision

Agent HQ Guard exists because **autonomous AI development needs governance**, not gatekeeping. We're building the tools that let teams:

- ‚úÖ Adopt AI agents with confidence
- ‚úÖ Maintain financial and security controls
- ‚úÖ Meet compliance requirements
- ‚úÖ Build audit trails for the AI era

This is a **personal R&D passion project** born from the need to keep Universe 2025 agents from scribbling over `main`‚Äîbut it's designed to scale with the entire industry.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Post-merge cleanup hooks for sqlite overrides
- [ ] Severity-aware PR review annotations
- [ ] Windows MCP alignment for per-tool approvals
- [ ] Enhanced observability dashboards
