- **[Provenance](provenance.md)** — Cryptographic signing and verification

## 💡 Key Concepts

### What Agent HQ Guard Does

Agent HQ Guard enforces **policy-driven governance** for autonomous AI agent runs:

- 🔒 **Agent Authorization** — Control which AI providers can execute
- 💰 **Budget Enforcement** — Hard limits on token consumption
- 🛡️ **Protected Paths** — Block changes to sensitive files without approval
- ✍️ **Provenance** — Require cryptographic signatures for auditability

### Two Integration Paths

**Compatibility Mode (Default):**
- Works with any GitHub Actions workflow
- Uses GitHub Checks API to block merges
- No special access required

**Native Mission Control (Feature-Flagged):**
- Requires `AGENT_HQ_API_URL` environment variable
- Streams decisions upstream before tools execute
- Reduced latency for policy violations

### How It Works

1. **Agent workflow** runs and generates a credential manifest
2. **Guard Action** validates manifest locally (fast feedback)
3. **Guard App** downloads manifest and evaluates policy
4. **Policy Engine** (OPA) determines allow/deny
5. **Provenance Library** verifies signatures
6. **GitHub Checks** API blocks merge if policy fails
